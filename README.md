# Tooling API Java test app

## Building WSC
```
  git clone https://github.com/lcampos/tooling-jar-builder.git
  mvn clean package
```

## Run
For now, import the project as a Maven project on the IDE of your choice and run it from there.

## Important
This is just a POC and everything is hardcoded to the checked in WSDL file. Expect code to keep changing. Also, understanding of how [https://github.com/forcedotcom/wsc/][wsc_git_repo] project is expected.
